# Alien Abduction Game Using Pygame

Game Idea: Alien abduction adventure
Imagine being an extraterrestrial pilot navigating the vastness of space in your reliable UFO. Regrettably, you're lagging behind in meeting your weekly aduction quota, much to the dissatisfaction of the Intergalatic Federation. To evade cosmic penalties, you must carry out abductions on diverse targets found on Earth.

<h3>Mechanics</h3>

**Abduction quota and levels:**
At the beginning of every stage, a particular abduction target is assigned, indicating the number of cows you need to abduct to advance. The game comprises ten levels, each featuring a higher quota. Advancing through one level unlocks the next and resets the quota counter.

**UFO Controls:**
Navigate the UFO across the game screen using the arrow keys or your preferred controls. Successful abductions require precise movements, and mastering the controls is essential for efficiently acquiring targets.

**Targets - Cows:**
Charming, pixelated cows roam the Earth's surface as your targets. Approach a cow, engage your tractor beam (press the space bar), and witness the cow vanish from your screen.

**Tractor beam mechanics:**
Activate the tractor beam by pressing the space bar; it extends from your UFO to the ground. When the beam makes contact with a cow, it initiates the abduction process, causing the cow to vanish. This action boosts both your score and abduction quota.

**Timer and Urgency:**
A countdown timer accompanies each level, introducing a sense of urgency to your abductions. Achieving the abduction quota before the timer reaches zero guarantees progression to the next level.
